<h1>MACHINE LEARNING BASICS</h1>

<p>
  EDA - Exploratory data analysis is one of the most important aspects of machine learning .
        This is used to understand the data and to get a clear knowledge about the data provided
        to us and to understand the patterns found in the data by also visualizing the data.

        There are many various libraries used in performing machine learning algorithms,
        some of them are pandas, numpy, matlpot, seaborn, etc.
        matplot and seaborn are used for data visualization.

  <h3>SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION</h3>
Simple linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. It assumes a linear association between the predictor (independent) variable and the target (dependent) variable. The model estimates a line that best fits the data by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values. It's expressed as Y = β0 + β1X + ε, where Y is the predicted value, X is the predictor variable, β0 and β1 are the intercept and slope coefficients, respectively, and ε represents the error term. Simple linear regression serves as a foundational tool for predicting and understanding relationships between variables in a straightforward manner.
