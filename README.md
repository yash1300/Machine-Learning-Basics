<h1>MACHINE LEARNING BASICS</h1>

<p>
  EDA - Exploratory data analysis is one of the most important aspects of machine learning .
        This is used to understand the data and to get a clear knowledge about the data provided
        to us and to understand the patterns found in the data by also visualizing the data.

        There are many various libraries used in performing machine learning algorithms,
        some of them are pandas, numpy, matlpot, seaborn, etc.
        matplot and seaborn are used for data visualization.
